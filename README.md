A RBG block simulator built with Unity, thanks for checking it out.

I am not affiliated with the folks who make chromadepth glasses, if you do happen to have a pair, it can produce a pretty cool effect. Oh, the Unity Project is included in the 'code' folder if you dare to edit your experience... Good luck!

If you do not have glasses, you can buy them from these places if you want.
