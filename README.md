# Patience
A block simulator built with Unity, thanks for checking it out.

Oh, the Unity Project is included in the 'code' folder if you dare to edit your experience... Good luck! I am not affiliated with the folks who make chromadepth glasses, if you do happen to have a pair, it can produce a pretty cool effect but it is not a requirement.

If you do not have glasses, you can buy them from these places if you want.
