# Patience
RBG block simulator that should be used with chromadepth glasses.

I am not affiliated with the folks who make them, I just wanted to share a nice experience. Oh, the bits to edit this game in unity are included in the 'code' folder if you dare... I don't have a way to gracefully exit out of the program.

Good luck!

If you do not have glasses, you can buy them from these places if you want.
