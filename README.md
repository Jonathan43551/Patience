A block simulator built with Unity, thanks for checking it out.

Oh, the Unity Project is included in the 'code' folder if you dare to edit your experience... Good luck! If you happen to have chromadepth or diffraction glasses, it can produce a pretty cool effect but it is not a requirement.

Check out these shops to buy glasses if you need 'em,
